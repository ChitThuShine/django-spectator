==================
 Django Spectator 
==================

A Django app to track book reading, movie viewing, gig going and play watching.

Very much a work in progress.

Notes
-----

``devproject/`` is a basic Django project to use the app locally. Use it like::

$ pip install -r devproject/requirements.txt
$ python setup.py develop
$ ./devproject/manage.py runserver
